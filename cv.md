3. I am a beginner Frontend-developer. I have been studying programming languages for about 3 months. The direction of Frontend development in Js attracts me very much and I spend a lot of time studying them. I believe that through hard work I can become a good programmer.
4. I have a *"middle"* level of skills in working with HTML, CSS, and Git. *"Elementary"* level of JavaScript.
5. I didn't have any projects, so you will see code examples in the future.
